notes:
-the rvalue should be close to 0 for the linear regression because x and y are
both independent and uniformly random samples from the distribution. thus even
though the code to produce them is the same they have no relationship (i.e.,
given one uniformly random value you are not going to have any advantage in
guessing another), which is why there is no correlation
