notes:
-for task 1, the tests print out the value of the built-in function join, but
 should be using the defined function my_join. using this you can see that the
 separator is added at the end even though it shouldn't be
-in church_theft.py, could use more descriptive function names. please also
 avoid reusing function names (getkey) to avoid confusion
-nice use of commenting throughout, could try a bit more testing in the future
