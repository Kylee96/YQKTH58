notes:
-the else block in bin_find and bin_find_1 will never get run, since the first
 three conditions cover all possible cases (<, >, ==)
-the find functions should actually return the found data, rather than just
 print things
-in shapeshift.py, should do the sorting just once after the loop is over
-some of the code in utilities.py looks very similar to that of other students,
 so you won't get full credit for it 
-church_theft won't work since the formatted date isn't added to the list
