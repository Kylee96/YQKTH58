notes:
-in filter.py, instructions said to define the lambda part in a function.
 could have done more testing
-in map.py, need to cast as float in formula
-in churchtheft.py, should hand in without printing out all crime details
 (makes it hard to find numbers). it makes the code brittle to get the free
 text field using hardcoded constants like [48:], better to split along the
 delimiters
-the code in churchtheft.py looks very similar to that of another set of
 students. please be more explicit about who you work with in the future
-nice use of list comprehensions, great commenting
