There are quite alot of thefts related to church roofing, 94 to be exact, which was counted using the filter function that was applied to the data set.
However, on closer inspection and manual checking, I realised that some of the selected data mention roof, but the suspect was unable to steal anything.
The suspect only managed to make it onto the roof, but went away without anything. Some examples of such data include "approach unattended secure property
climb onto group floor roof and proceed to part remove and roll up the lead ridge flashing make off empty handed", "unknown suspect(s) under cover of darkness
approach rear of church building before use means unknown to climb onto roof before use means unknown to attempt to pull approximately 8feet of lead flashing
from roof but fail leaving it damaged in situ". However, all these data are still included into the count of the number of thefts that involve stealing parts
of a roof.
