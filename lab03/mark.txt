notes:
-in swap.py, it's possible to do it using only one temporary variable
-in while_list.py, better to not mutate mylist but instead just print
 mylist[x] + 1
-in write_world.py, better to not hardcode file location 
-in hangman.py, shown_phrase is never used and program can't handle user
 entering uppercase letters. it also adds multiple guessed characters if the
 user enters multiple letters (like try entering 'nod'), even though it 
 prints the correct message
